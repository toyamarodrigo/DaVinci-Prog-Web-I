        <h1 class="titulo">What is Haiku</h1>
        <div class="haikuinfo">
            <p>
                A haiku is a traditionally Japanese poem consisting of <b>three short lines that do not rhyme.</b> The origins of haiku poems can be traced back as far as the 9th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Haiku is considered to be more than a type of poem; <b>it is a way of looking at the physical world and seeing something deeper, like the very nature of existence.</b> <br> It should leave the reader with a strong feeling or impression. Take a look at the following examples of traditional and modern haiku poems to see what we mean.

        <h2 class="titulo"> Traditional Haiku</h2>
        <div class="haikuinfo">
            <p>
                There were four master haiku poets from Japan, known as <b>"the Great Four:" Matsuo Basho, Kobayashi Issa, Masaoka Shiki, and Yosa Buson.</b> <br> Their work is still the model for traditional haiku writing today. We have also included examples from Natsume Soseki here, <br> a famed novelist and contemporary of Shiki, who also wrote haiku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reviewing examples of haiku poems is an excellent way to become familiar with this form of poetry and the sensory language it uses,and gain some inspiration.

            <p>
                In Japanese, there are five "moras" in the first and third line, and seven in the second, following the standard 5-7-5 structure of haiku. A mora is a sound unit, much like a syllable, <br> but is not identical to it. This rhythm is often lost in translation, as not every English word has the same number of syllables, or moras, as its Japanese counterpart. <br> For example, haiku has two syllables in English and in Japanese, it has three moras.

                An old silent pond... <br>
                A frog jumps into the pond, <br>
                splash! Silence again. <br>
            </p>

                Autumn moonlight- <br>
                a worm digs silently <br>
                into the chestnut. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the twilight rain <br>
                these brilliant-hued hibiscus - <br>
                A lovely sunset. <br>
